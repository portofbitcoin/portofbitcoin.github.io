<h1>Port of Bitcoin</h1>

As the world comes to rely more on the world of bits for everything from wealth storage to national defense there is an increasing chasm at the heart of societies where everyone from citizens to financial institutions to governments are woefully unprepared for operating securely and succeeding in it.
Even in the Bitcoin ecosystem which historically has attracted some of the smartest developers in the world adoption of the latest technological upgrades is stagnating.
<br></br>
There are three strands Port of Bitcoin will initially focus on: education, advisory and software products. Even if someone isn’t convinced by Bitcoin as a financial investment there is still much to learn in terms of online security practices that Bitcoin is pushing the boundaries on. There is also so much software to be built out that takes advantage of the underlying protocols but doesn’t fundamentally change them.
<br></br>
If you are an individual who is interested in the educational element, a financial institution interested in the advisory element or a developer interested in contributing to future software products email <b>contact at portofbitcoin dot com</b>. Don’t settle for mediocrity. Don’t compromise on standards. Build things that last and change history.
